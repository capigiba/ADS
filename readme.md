# ADS App

A simple Streamlit application for managing PDF job descriptions. Upload PDFs, configure job metadata, and manage records with soft-delete functionality.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)
- Recommended: **virtualenv** or **venv** for isolated environments

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (if using Git):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd test
   ```
   If you already have the project files locally, simply `cd` into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/test
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   If a `requirements.txt` is provided:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Otherwise, install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. **Open in browser**:
   By default, Streamlit runs on `http://localhost:8501`. Your terminal will show the exact URL.

3. **Navigate between pages**:
   - **Upload**: Upload a new PDF and configure job-related weights.
   - **Manage**: View all uploaded records, preview PDFs, and soft-delete entries.
   - **Jobs**: Add, view, and edit job titles used in the upload form.

## Notes

- Uploaded PDFs are stored in `folder_pdf` with filenames generated by `utils/file_utils.py`.
- Soft-deleted records are marked in `records.csv` with `status = deleted` but the row remains for audit.
- Timestamps (`created_at` and `updated_at`) use ISO format.
